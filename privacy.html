                <p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. MAKING A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND WILL NOT INCREASE
                    YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY LAW.</p>

                <h2>1. PROMOTION DESCRIPTION:</h2>

                <p>The “WIN RAPTORS PLAYOFF TICKETS” ("Sweepstakes") begins on April 24, 2018 at 12:01 AM and ends on
                    May 10th, 2018 at 11:59 PM (the "Promotion Period").</p>
<p>
                    The sponsor of this Sweepstakes is Playing Bot ("Sponsor"). By participating in the Sweepstakes,
                    each Entrant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules and
                    the decisions of Sponsor, which shall be final and binding in all respects. Sponsor is responsible
                    for the collection, submission or processing of Entries and the overall administration of the
                    Sweepstakes. Entrants should look solely to Sponsor with any questions, comments or problems related
                    to the Sweepstakes. Sponsor may be reached by email at tim@playing.bot during the Promotion
                    Period.</p>

                <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY:</h2>

                Open to legal residents of Toronto & The Greater Toronto Area (“GTA”) who are 18 years of age or older (the "Entrant"). Sponsor, and their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, distributors, retailers, sales representatives, advertising and promotion agencies and each of their respective officers, directors and employees (the "Promotion Entities"), are ineligible to enter the Sweepstakes or win a prize. Household Members and Immediate Family Members of such individuals are also not eligible to enter or win. "Household Members" shall mean those people who share the same residence at least three months a year. "Immediate Family Members" shall mean parents, step-parents, legal guardians, children, step-children, siblings, step-siblings, or spouses. This Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited or restricted by law.


                <h2>3. PRIZES:</h2>

                <p>Grand Prize: 1 winner will receive 2 Raptors Playoff Tickets

                    Prizes cannot be transferred, redeemed for cash or substituted by winner. Sponsor reserves the right
                    in its sole and absolute discretion to award a substitute prize of equal or greater value if a prize
                    described in these Official Rules is unavailable or cannot be awarded, in whole or in part, for any
                    reason. The ARV of the prize represents Sponsor's good faith determination. That determination is
                    final and binding and cannot be appealed. If the actual value of the prize turns out to be less than
                    the stated ARV, the difference will not be awarded in cash. Sponsor makes no representation or
                    warranty concerning the appearance, safety or performance of any prize awarded. Restrictions,
                    conditions, and limitations may apply. Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prize items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Sweepstakes is open to legal residents of Toronto & The GTA and Prize will only be awarded
                    and/or delivered to addresses within said locations. All federal, state and/or local taxes, fees,
                    and surcharges are the sole responsibility of the prize winner. Failure to comply with the Official
                    Rules will result in forfeiture of the prize.</p>

                    Automated or robotic Entries submitted by individuals or organizations will be disqualified.

                    notification and/or entering services, will void Entrant's Entries and that Entrant may be
                    disqualified. Final eligibility for the award of any prize is subject to eligibility verification as
                    set forth below. All Entries must be posted by the end of the Promotion Period in order to
                    participate. Sponsor's database clock will be the official timekeeper for this Sweepstakes.</p>

                <h2>5. WINNER SELECTION:</h2>

                    failure to receive notification for any reason, including inactive email account(s), technical
                    difficulties associated therewith, or Winner’s failure to adequately monitor any email account.</p>

                <p>Any winner notification not responded to or returned as undeliverable may result in prize
                    forfeiture. The potential prize winner may be required to sign and return an affidavit of
                    eligibility and release of liability, and a Publicity Release (collectively "the Prize Claim
                    Documents"). No substitution or transfer of a prize is permitted except by Sponsor.</p>

                <h2>7. PRIVACY.</h2>

                <p>By entering the Sweepstakes, you grant Sponsor permission to share your email address and any other
                    personally identifiable information with the other Sweepstakes Entities for the purpose of
                    administration and prize fulfillment, including use in a publicly available Winners list. By
                    participating (except where prohibited by law), each entrant grants the Sweepstakes Parties the
                    irrevocable, sublicensable, absolute right and permission to use his/her name, likeness, photograph,
                    biographical information, voice, comments, and any other indicia of persona (regardless of whether
                    altered, changed, modiﬁed, edited, used alone, or used with other material in the Released Parties’
                    sole discretion) without further notice or payment of additional consideration in any publicity,
                    advertisement or other promotional, trade or commercial use carried out by or on behalf of the
                    Sweepstakes Parties in any media, current or not yet existing (including, without limitation, print,
                    broadcast or the internet) worldwide, without any limitation of time and without notice, review or
                    approval and each entrant releases all Released Parties from any and all liability related thereto.
                    Nothing contained in these Oﬃcial Rules obligates Playing Bot to make use of any of the rights
                    granted herein and each entrant waives any right to inspect or approve any such use.</p>

                <h2>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</h2>

                    information, or for any faulty or failed electronic data transmissions; (b) any unauthorized access
                    to, or theft, destruction or alteration of entries at any point in the operation of this
                    Sweepstakes; (c) any technical malfunction, failure, error, omission, interruption, deletion,
                    defect, delay in operation or communications line failure, regardless of cause, with regard to any
                    equipment, systems, networks, lines, satellites, servers, camera, computers or providers utilized in
                    any aspect of the operation of the Sweepstakes; (d) inaccessibility or unavailability of any network

                    participant's or to any other person’s computer or mobile device which may be related to or
                    resulting from any attempt to participate in the Sweepstakes or download of any materials in the
                    Sweepstakes.</p>
                <p>
                    If, for any reason, the Sweepstakes is not capable of running as planned for reasons which may

                    the right to award any remaining prizes (up to the total ARV as set forth in these Official Rules)
                    in a manner deemed fair and equitable by Sponsor. Sponsor and Released Parties shall not have any
